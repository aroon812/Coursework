Matrix multiplication program that generates two random matricies, multiplies them, and compares the performance of a sequential version of 
the algorithm with a multithreaded version of the algorithm. In the command line arguments, the user specifies if they want to run the parallel 
or sequential version of the algorithm, followed by the number of threads the multithreaded algorithm will use, followed by the length/height of the matricies.
